# World Hammer

World Hammer is a tool designed to help world builders build more and more realistic worlds. Sometimes you need a world, but don't want to painstakingly build every aspect of it yourself. Maybe you're running an RPG campaign and just need a believable setting for your plot. Maybe you're a worldbuilder who's more interested in culture and magic than in locations and names. Then World Hammer is the tool for you.

Not just a map generator, World Hammer also gives you a list of names in each of the fictional languages of the world, and a 2 000 year history of conquest, division, and advancement.

World Hammer is inspired by previous fantasy map generators like [Azgaar's one](azgaar.github.io/Fastasy-Map-Generator), but has more of an emphasis on realism. While it is not as interactive as some generators, and it does not generate fine detais ike city populations and mine locations. It does, however, account for several features missing in other generators that are noticeable on the macroscopic scale, such as planetary curvature, plate tectonics, and linguistic drift.
