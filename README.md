# World Hammer

World Hammer is a tool designed to help world builders build more and more realistic
worlds. Sometimes you need a world, but don't want to painstakingly build every
aspect of it yourself. Maybe you're running an RPG campaign and just need a
believable setting for your plot. Maybe you're a world builder who's more interested
in culture and magic than in locations and names. Then World Hammer is the tool for
you.

Not just a map generator, World Hammer also gives you an info sheet on each country,
a list of names in each language, and a 3&thinsp;000 year history of conquest,
division, and advancement across the world.

World Hammer is inspired by previous fantasy map generators like
[Azgaar's one](azgaar.github.io/Fastasy-Map-Generator), but has more of an emphasis
on realism. It is not as interactive as some generators, and it does not generate as
many fine details like mine locations and diplomatic relations. It does, however,
account for several features missing in other generators that are noticeable on the
macroscopic scale, such as planetary curvature, plate tectonics, and linguistic
drift.

This project drew heavy inspiration from
[Azgaar's similar fantasy map generator](azgaar.github.io/fantasy-map-generator/). The slick aesthetic comes courtesy of
[the Bootstrap library](https://getbootstrap.com/) and
